    </header>

    <p class="paragragh1">Trade involves the transfer of goods and services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for
        money. Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market.

        Traders generally negotiate through a medium of credit or exchange, such as money. Though some economists
        characterize barter (i.e. trading things without the use of money) as an early form of trade, money was invented
        before written history began. Consequently, any story of how money first developed is mostly based on conjecture
        and logical inference. Letters of credit, paper money, and non-physical money have greatly simplified and
        promoted trade as buying can be separated from selling, or earning. Trade between two traders is called
        bilateral trade, while trade involving more than two traders is called multilateral trade.</p>

    <p class="paragraph2">Retail trade consists of the sale of goods or merchandise from a very fixed location. (such as a department
        store, boutique, or kiosk), online or by mail, in small or individual lots for direct consumption or use by the
        purchaser. Wholesale trade is the traffic in goods that are sold as merchandise to retailers, industrial,
        commercial, institutional, or other professional business users, or to other wholesalers and related
        subordinated services.

        Historically, openness to free trade substantially increased in some areas from 1815 until the outbreak of World
        War I in 1914. Trade openness increased again during the 1920s but collapsed (in particular in Europe and North
        America) during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Trade openness increased substantially again from the 1950s
        onward (albeit with a slowdown during the oil crisis of the 1970s). Economists and economic historians contend
        that current levels of trade openness are the highest they have ever been.</p>
